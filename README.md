## Description of Quantum Key Distribution Protocol

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method which implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. It enables two parties  to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is often incorrectly called Quantum cryptography, as it is the best known example of such a task.

An important and unique property of QKD is the ability of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party interference trying to gain the knowledge f the key. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states , a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. 

   **PROPERTIES AND MERITS**:
   
      1. Relies on the principles of quantum mechanics in contrast to traditional public key cryptography which relies on cerain mathematical functions.
      2. QKD has provable security based on information theory , and forward secrecy.
      
   **DRAWBACKS**:
   
      1. It relies on having an authenticated classical channel of communications.
      2. In modern cryptography, having an authenticated class channel means that one has either already developed or exchanged a symmetric key of sufficient length. 
      3. Thus QKD does the work of a stream cipher at many times the cost.

## Personal Experience

**MIT iQuHACK 2022** was really a fun and extraordinary experience for our whole team. We got to know a plethora of things, learnt to work on new challenges and even expanded our professional network by getting to know individuals from various backgrounds. On the technical side, our team worked on the challenge involving Quantum Key Distribution. For most of us this was our first event where we had to create something unique from scratch by referring to a problem statement. After much brainstorming and referring to various resources we have come up with a solution to the challenge. Every member of our team has worked hard on this project and we hope that our solution is useful for a unique application. At the end we would like to thank the organizers and also the mentors along with the staff for making this a memorable event for us.
